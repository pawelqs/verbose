The goal of verbose package is to manage the verbosity of R packages during R session. The package provides a `verbose()` function which can be used to set or get the verbosity level for a your package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of verbose from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pawelqs/verbose")
```

## Example

Let's assume that we want to implement a foo package and be able to globally set the verbosity level for all foo functions. We can use the verbose package to set the verbosity level for the foo package.

```{r example}
library(verbose)

verbose(foo = 1)
```

Now let's develop a foo function which will get the default verbosity level using th `verbose()` function.

```{r}
foo <- function(verbose = verbose::verbose("foo")) {
  if (verbose > 0) {
    message("Hello world!")
  }
}

foo()
```

Now, let's turn off the verbosity for the foo package.

```{r}
verbose(foo = 0)
foo()
```
